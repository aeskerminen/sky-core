# Sky Notes

Sky Notes is a minimalistic note-taking application with support for LaTeX formulas and drawing.

## Features

### Simple working environment

Users are greeted with an extremely intuitive working environment, where different tools are spread over three tabs. One can change tabs my clicking on them, or by using our carefully thought of keyboard shortcuts.

The tabs consist of a text-editing environment, LaTeX editor and a whiteboard for taking notes with pen tablets.

### Whiteboard
